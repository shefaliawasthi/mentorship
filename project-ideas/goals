Goals
Create a simple, convenient, and easy-to-use website that pairs people together in groups/teams:
- Students input their schedule and availability
- Students answer set questions. Answers used for matching
- Teacher can see all matched pairs and can view everyones schedules
- Teacher can move students around and change the number of people in each pair
- Matched pairs can view potential “meeting dates/times”
- 2 modes: Teacher mode, Student mode

NOTE: important to figure out how the students will be matched. it will either be based on 1 question, multiple questions, randomizer or a point system. Perhaps we can toggle the different ways people can be matched. 
Create login page [POSSIBLY]:
- Create “classes” so set lists of students that can be saved and referred to later
- Create “saved teams” so specific pairings can be saved 
- Students can sync their calendars with Google Calendar
- OPTION: students can put in their preferences of who they want to work with
- OPTION: ask students to sign up with their email accounts. after groups have been made, either create a chatroom with the members using the emails or give students the option to share their contact information with the other members
- OPTION: shuffle groups button. provide multiple options so they can be different with a push of w button

Code chatbot to answer FAQs:
- Set list of questions and answers
- Use NLP to pick up on keywords
- Prompt user with questions if keywords are not detected

Feedback:
- EITHER add a form where people manually input their experience working with their matched group in paragraph form and NLP is used to extract the connotation of their message
- OR create a game were they can rate their experience on a scale from 1-5 (easier for data crunching)
- EITHER WAY: people running the website will have to improve the matched pairs (unless we figure out how to self-improve WHICH could just mean not pairing those two people up again).
